## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

All files are in *src/main/java* path.

Main method is in *CreditCardProcessor.java*

## Commands to execute the project

Make sure you are in CardValidator
> cd CardValidator

Then install maven
> mvn install

Compile the project using maven
> mvn compile

Then we can manually test for all the file types:

JSON command:
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="resources/input_file.json resources/output_file.json”

XML command:
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="resources/input_file.xml resources/output_file.xml"

CSV command:
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="resources/input_file.csv resources/output_file.csv”



## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
